    Snow is falling<br>
    All around me<br>
    Children playing<br>
    Having fun<br>
    <br>
    It's the season<br>
    Love and understanding<br>
    Merry Christmas everyone<br>
    <br>
    Time for parties and celebration<br>
    People dancing all night long<br>
    Time for presents<br>
    And exchanging kisses<br>
    Time for singing Christmas songs<br>
    <br>
    We're gonna have a party tonight<br>
    I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe<br>
    We'll kiss by candlelight<br>
    <br>
    reverse
    <br>
    Room is swaying, records playing<br>
    All the old songs, we love to hear<br>
    All I wish that everyday was Christmas<br>
    What a nice way to spend the year<br>
    <br>
    We're gonna have a party tonight<br>
    I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe<br>
    We'll kiss by candlelight<br>
    <br>
    Snow is falling<br>
    All around me<br>
    Children playing<br>
    Having fun<br>
    It's the season<br>
    Love and understanding<br>
    Merry Christmas everyone<br>
    Merry Christmas everyone<br>
    <br>
    Ooh merry Christmas everyone<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Snow is falling<br>
    All around me<br>
    Children playing<br>
    Having fun<br>
    It's the season<br>
    Love and understanding<br>
    Merry Christmas everyone<br>
